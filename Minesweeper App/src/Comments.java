When this happens the game should uncover all remaining squares containing mines.


The user wins when all squares without mines are uncovered.

Use the 9x9 grid with white squares as your minefield region
Mines will be represented by black squares

Flags will be represented by red squares and will be toggled with a mouse RIGHT CLICK.
Covered squares will be represented by white squares.
