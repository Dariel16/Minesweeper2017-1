 The initial setup consists of a grid of squares some of which contain hidden mines
 
The user clicks on squares repeatedly until one of two events occur: a mine is found or the last square without a mine is uncovered.

The user looses the game immediately as soon as he/she clicks on a square that contains a mine.  
When this happens the game should uncover all remaining squares containing mines.

If the selected square does not contain a mine but one or more of the eight surrounding squares contain a mine,
 then the game should display a number on the selected square representing how many of the eight surrounding squares contain mines
 
If the selected square does not contain a mine and none of its eight surrounding squares contain mines, 
the game should recursively uncover every adjacent square that does not contain a mine until a 
square that does contain a surrounding mine is uncovered.  This last square should contain a number 
representing the number of its surrounding squares that contain mines

The user wins when all squares without mines are uncovered.

User may flag squares (using the mouse right click button) that he/she believes contain mines

Use the provided source code as a starting point as follows:

Use the 9x9 grid with white squares as your minefield region
Mines will be represented by black squares

Flags will be represented by red squares and will be toggled with a mouse RIGHT CLICK.
Covered squares will be represented by white squares.
Uncovered squares will be represented by gray squares.
Uncovered squares will reflect the number of surrounding mines or be empty if no such surrounding mine exits.
